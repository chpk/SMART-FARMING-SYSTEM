An IOT application with several sensors to measure parameters like temperature & humidity, air quality
, soil moisture these sensor values(code for it is present in iot folder) are stored in a local database and then a python script does Machine
Learning on the available sensor values of various locations and after learning it detects the rainfall
occurrence(classification via SVM using Sklearn,Scikit). Data analysis of the sensorâ€™s data is also done.
